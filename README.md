Welcome to the **SmartLamp-SmartGlow** project! This is an IoT-based smart lighting solution featuring a 2.4" TFT touchscreen and two addressable WS2812B LED strips. The lamp can be controlled via a touchscreen interface or remotely through Home Assistant using MQTT. It supports multiple lighting effects, brightness adjustment, and color selection.

## Features
- **Dual LED Control**: Manages two separate WS2812B LED strips (30 and 32 LEDs).
- **Touchscreen Interface**: 2.4" ILI9341 TFT with XPT2046 touchscreen for local control.
- **Multiple Effects**: Static, Breath, Rainbow, Chase, Blink, and Wave animations.
- **Remote Control**: Integration with Home Assistant via MQTT.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Adjustable brightness levels (0-100%).
- **Color Selection**: 15 predefined colors with RGB support.
- **Time Display**: Real-time clock using NTP (Network Time Protocol).
- **Energy Saving**: Automatic screen timeout during nighttime.

## Hardware Requirements
To build this project, you will need the following components:

### Components
- **ESP32 Development Board** (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)
- **2.4" ILI9341 TFT LCD with XPT2046 Touchscreen** (320x240 resolution)
- **WS2812B LED Strips** (1x 30 LEDs, 1x 32 LEDs)
- **Level Shifter** (optional, 3.3V to 5V, e.g., 74HCT245)
- **Power Supply**: 5V, minimum 3A
- **Jumper Wires** (male-to-female and male-to-male)
- **Breadboard** (for prototyping)
- **Resistor**: 220-470 Ohm (1 piece, for LED data line)
- **Capacitor**: 1000ÂµF, 6.3V or higher (optional, for power stabilization)

### Pin Connections
| ESP32 Pin       | Connection                |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| 3.3V            | TFT VCC, Level Shifter (if used) |
| 5V (External)   | LED Strips VCC            |
| GND             | TFT GND, LED Strips GND, Power Supply GND |
| GPIO 5          | LED Strip 1 DIN (with 220-470 Ohm resistor) |
| GPIO 13         | LED Strip 2 DIN (with 220-470 Ohm resistor) |
| GPIO 21         | TFT Backlight Control     |
| GPIO 25         | TFT CLK (XPT2046_CLK)     |
| GPIO 32         | TFT MOSI (XPT2046_MOSI)   |
| GPIO 33         | TFT CS (XPT2046_CS)       |
| GPIO 39         | TFT MISO (XPT2046_MISO)   |

- **Note**: Connect all GND pins to a common ground. Use a separate 5V power supply for LED strips to avoid overloading the ESP32.

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**: Version 1.8.x or later.
- **ESP32 Board Support**: Install via Arduino Board Manager.
- **Libraries**:
  - `TFT_eSPI` (for TFT display)
  - `XPT2046_Touchscreen` (for touchscreen)
  - `FastLED` (for LED control)
  - `Preferences` (for storing settings)
  - `WiFi` and `PubSubClient` (for MQTT)
  - `NTPClient` (for time synchronization)
- **Home Assistant**: For MQTT integration (optional).
- **MQTT Broker**: e.g., Mosquitto.

## Installation
1. **Set Up Arduino IDE**:
   - Install the Arduino IDE and add ESP32 board support (via Board Manager).
   - Install the required libraries using the Library Manager or manually.

2. **Connect Hardware**:
   - Assemble the circuit according to the pin connections table above.
   - Ensure the power supply is connected and all GNDs are common.

3. **Configure the Code**:
   - Open `dual_smart_led_lamp.ino` in Arduino IDE.
   - Update the following constants with your network and MQTT details:
     - `ssid`: Your WiFi SSID
     - `password`: Your WiFi password
     - `mqtt_server`: Your MQTT broker IP address
     - `mqtt_user`: Your MQTT username
     - `mqtt_password`: Your MQTT password

4. **Upload the Code**:
   - Select your ESP32 board and port in Arduino IDE.
   - Click "Upload" to flash the code to the ESP32.

5. **Test the Setup**:
   - Power on the device and check the touchscreen interface.
   - Verify LED strips light up and respond to touch inputs.

## Usage
- **Touchscreen Controls**:
  - **Up/Down Buttons**: Adjust brightness.
  - **Mode Button**: Cycle through lighting effects (Static, Breath, Rainbow, Chase, Blink, Wave).
  - **Color Button**: Cycle through 15 predefined colors.
  - **On/Off Button**: Toggle the LED strips on or off.
- **Home Assistant Integration**:
  - Configure MQTT in Home Assistant using the provided `configuration.yaml` snippet.
  - Control the lamp remotely via the Home Assistant UI.
